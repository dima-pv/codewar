# You have a natural number d.
#
# You need to write a function f(d) which finds the smallest positive number n having d divisors .
#
# For example:
#
# f(1) = 1
# f(3) = 4
# f(60) = 5040
# f(420) = 9979200
# In this kata all the tests will be with 1 <= d <= 10000
#
# Keep in mind that n can be on the order of 1030010^{300}10
# 300
#  , so iterating over n and finding the divisors in total for O(n(n)O(n\sqrt{\mathstrut n})O(n
# (n
# â€‹
#  ) operations is not an option.
#
# Good luck!
