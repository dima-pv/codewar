# Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.
#
# Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
#
# You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
#
# If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.
#
# All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
