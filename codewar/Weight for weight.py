# My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with
#     the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.
#
# I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list".
# It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.
#
# For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99.
#
# Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights"
# of these numbers?
#
# Example:
# "56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes:
#
# "100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"
# When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings (alphabetical ordering) and not numbers:
#
# 180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9), it comes before as a string.
#
# All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.
